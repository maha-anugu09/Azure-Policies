# Azure-Policies

In the above attached files there are azure Policies to limit resource types, enforce tags and its values and also to limit locations where the resources can be deployed.
We can pass parameters according to the script. 
The policy rule consists of If and Then blocks. In the If block, you can define one or more conditions that specify when the policy is enforced. You can apply logical operators to these conditions to precisely define the scenario for a policy.
In the Then block, you define the effect that happens when the If conditions are fulfilled. 
For example, you can define to limit the locations where they can be deployed, while limiting the resource types.
By using Azure Policies you can manage the cost and also resources.
